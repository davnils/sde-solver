Solver for stochastic differential equations. Work in progress.
The code is written with a custom haskell-unicode plugin for vim, replacing math-stuff with unicode symbols, hence partial differentials and similar might look a little unappetizing.

Compile with: ghc --make -O2 -funbox-strict-fields Main.hs
