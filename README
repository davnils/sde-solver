Solver for stochastic differential equations. Under development.

Future goals:

* Cleanup with type synonyms and make it easier to use
* Several instances of SDE for common problems
* Support for correlation between several random vars
* Parallel solving on a local CPU
* Parallel solving on a cluster using MPI
* Parallel solving on a GPU-cluster using MPI and Accelerate
