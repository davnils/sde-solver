Solver for stochastic differential equations. Work in progress.
The code is written with a custom haskell-unicode plugin for vim, replacing math-stuff with unicode symbols, hence partial differentials and similar might look a little unappetizing.

Compile with: ghc --make -O2 -funbox-strict-fields Main.hs

Future goals:

* Cleanup with type synonyms and make it easier to use
* Several instances of SDE for common problems
* Support for correlation between several random vars
* Parallel solving on a local CPU <- DONE
* Parallel solving on a cluster using MPI
* Parallel solving on a GPU-cluster using MPI and Accelerate
